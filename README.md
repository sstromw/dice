<!-- Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like [@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/plugins/plugin-webpack) or [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) to your `snowpack.config.mjs` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same. -->

# Dice Roller and Probability Calculator Webapp

(made by Sam)

This project is incomplete, but these are the features I'm working on.

- Roll arbitrary dice. Here "dice" means any discrete random variable
    - uniform, binomial, geometric, Poisson, etc.
    - sums, products, minimums, maximums, etc.
- Calculate statistical information for your "dice".
    - probability tables (TODO sam get plotly.js working)
    - means, variances, medians, percentiles, entropy, etc.
